## Abstract

Slides are commonly used to present information and tell stories. In academic and research communities, slides are typically used to summarize findings in accepted papers for presentation in meetings and conferences. These slides for academic papers usually contain common and essential topics such as major contributions, model design, experiment details and future work. In this paper, we aim to automatically generate slides for academic papers. We first conducted an in-depth analysis of how humans create slides. We then mined frequently used slide topics. Given a topic, our approach extracts relevant sentences in the paper to provide the draft slides. Due to the lack of labeling data, we integrate prior knowledge of ground truth sentences into a log-linear model to create an initial pseudo-target distribution. Two sentence extractors are learned collaboratively and bootstrap the performance of each other. Evaluation results on a labeled test set show that our model can extract more relevant sentences than baseline methods. Human evaluation also shows slides generated by our model can serve as a good basis for preparing the final presentations.

## Dataset

### Unsupervised Training Data

We use the [ACL Anthology Reference Corpus](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/) [(Bird et al. 2008)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L08-1005/) as the unlabeled corpus of papers for our unsupervised learning.

It contains 22,878 publications in the ACL Anthology up to December 2015. The corpus provides the original PDF format as well as the automatically extracted text with logical structure (e.g., section information) via [ParsCit](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/parsCit) [(Councill, Giles, and Kan 2008)](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/Publications/PDF/ParsCit-%20An%20open-source%20CRF%20reference%20string%20parsing%20package.pdf).

### Test Annotation

We select 100 papers from the ACL corpus, which we found corresponding presentations on the Web. Two annotators with rich research experience are asked to annotate relevant sentences in the papers for each of the four slide topics. We use the union sets of their annotations as the final ground truth sentences for evaluation.
